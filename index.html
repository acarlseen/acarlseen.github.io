                     California's Bay Area. I've spent the last 20 years in hospitality/culinary
                    roles&mdash; from pizza shops to <i>Chef's Table</i> worthy Michelin-starred kitchens at Al's Place and Commis.
                    Now I look forward to new experiences in an engineering role, making use of problem solving skills, my attention to
                    detail, and production mindset cultivated along the way.

                    Working in hospitality has provided great opportunities for me to learn valuable skills useful in any
                    environment. The career involves daily long hours full of urgent activity. Environments are stressful, and
                    and communication is key for making plans around resources and solving problems under tremendous pressure
                    as as team. I look forward to working in the next challenging environment, using well-honed technical and soft
                    skills to win in a team environment.

                        Because big things almost always require teamwork, soft skills are critical 
                        for any workplace. Over my career, I have learned to communicate calmly in
                        stressful situations. I have worked with my teams to practice generosity and
                        kindness in our work dynamics, learning to communicate in ways that each
                        individual can receive. The task at hand is difficult, and working with me
                        is easy.

                    Hobbies:<br>
                    Obviously, I love cooking and dining out. My partner is my favorite person to cook for.
                    We like to host dinner parties occasionally. I like to spend time with friends playing
                    table top games, or getting out on nice bike ride.
